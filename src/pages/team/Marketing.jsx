I‚Äôm a current JD student at UNSW and a first-generation American born to Punjabi-Indian parents. I‚Äôve always had a deep love for culture, community, and bringing people together, which is exactly what drew me to this society!\n\n Outside of Mahjong and marketing, I‚Äôm passionate about advocacy and service. I‚Äôve held leadership positions in several student associations and represented the U.S. internationally as Miss USA, becoming the first Punjabi-Indian woman to earn that title. My background includes legal work, community volunteering (including refugee support and homelessness outreach), and performing arts (I‚Äôm a trained dancer and singer!).\n\n I believe board games are a powerful way to connect across cultures, make friends, and de-stress, especially during law school! As a Marketing Subcommittee Member, I‚Äôm committed to helping the society grow, create inclusive events, and highlight the joy and strategy behind every game we play.\n\n Whether you're a Mahjong master or a curious beginner, come join us, I can‚Äôt wait¬†to¬†meet¬†you!",
